    <!--  Normally to add javascript in your html in two ways:
    1) Internal javascript
    2) External javascript

    Internal javascript ==> place your script tag under head tag
    -->

    <script>


        // var variable_name=value; var is a keyword of javascript for declaring a variable.
        // ' ; ' this is terminator it is not necessary to use in js but for better practice you should end every
        // statement with terminator mark.
        // To display the value of a variable we normally use
        /*
         * 1) alert(variablename);
         * 2) document.write()
         3) document.writeln()

         1)Number
         2)String
         3)Boolean
         4)Null
         5)Undefined
         6)Objects

        //Browser reads js sequentially

        var greeting='Say helo to step#1 of Javascript';// within ' ' or " " indicates that it is a string
        alert(greeting);
        alert("greeting");
        //alert(Greeting);//error

        /*
         * Note:
         * In first alert there is a varible greeting;
         * In second alert there is string not a variable which we defined therefore on alert it displays greeting itself
         * In third alert there is undefined variable , Undefined means that variable is not declare
         * js is a case sensitive there greeting is different from Greeting.
         *There are certain rules to define a name of variable .... read it from book
         *
